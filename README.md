## Particles

Particles is a fullscreen, interactive particle simulation built with Python and Pygame. The program renders hundreds of small particles that move smoothly across the screen in random directions, wrapping seamlessly at the edges to create an infinite, flowing visual effect.

Each particle is initialized with a random position, velocity, and direction. Their motion is calculated using trigonometric functions, resulting in natural-looking movement. The simulation runs in real time and updates continuously at a steady frame rate.

The application includes keyboard-controlled color switching, allowing the user to instantly change the color of all particles during runtime. This makes the simulation both interactive and visually dynamic.
